# Good-practice (GxP) and Quilt

## Overview

GxP environments for labs, manufacturing, documentation, and clinical practice
require what we call a "data chain of custody" that enables Quilt users to understand
where data came from, who produced it, when it was produced, and why it should
be trusted.

The GxP module for Quilt includes the following key features:

1. Strong cryptographic checksums for data at the object level and at the collection
(or package) level
1. Integrated IQ (installation qualification) and OQ (operational qualification)
testing to help you automate tedious manual qualification cycles into tests run
by machines and reported to you.

## Status monitoring

### Architectural overview

The Quilt status monitoring system consists of four parts:

1. *Canaries:* A collection of end-to-end quality tests for key
operational functionality provided by Quilt. They are run on a
schedule in your AWS infrastructure.
2. *Status reports:* Simple HTML files generated on a daily schedule
by an AWS Lambda function (`status_reports`) and stored in a dedicated
Amazon S3 bucket. The HTML files contain the most recent canary run
results (Operational Qualification) and Quilt instance Cloud Formation
parameters and outputs (Infrastructure Qualification).
   1. Operational Qualification report: all canary test results and
   status (historical and current)
   2. Infrastructure Qualification report: all CloudFormation parameters
   and status
3. *Administrative User Interface:* An HTML page in the Quilt catalog
that displays the current operational status of a Quilt instance
and provides access to current and historical status reports.
4. *Amazon SNS topic:* Users can subscribe to the topic and receive
canary error notifications (available as `CanaryNotificationsTopic`
stack output).

![Example status report](../imgs/catalog-status-example-status-report.png)

### Setting up status monitoring for a Quilt instance

In order to enable status monitoring for a Quilt instance, the
following conditions must be met:

- The Quilt instance CloudFormation template must have canaries
enabled
- The correct template parameters must be provided during the Quilt instance
CloudFormation deployment

The required Quilt and AWS resources are provisioned automatically
by the Quilt deployment.

#### List of canaries

There are currently four end-to-end quality tests:

- `BucketAccessControl`: Test that Users can only access specifically
allowed Amazon S3 buckets
- `Immutable URIs`: Test to resolve immutable Quilt URIs
- `PackagePushUi`: Test package `push` functionality via Quilt
catalog package creation dialog
- `Search`: Search S3 objects and Quilt packages in the Quilt catalog

#### Quilt instance CloudFormation deployment parameters

When deploying a Quilt instance using a CloudFormation template
with canaries enabled, you will have to provide the following
parameters:

- `CanaryNotificationsEmail` (if enabled): A valid email address
to send canary failure and error notifications

### Accessing current operational status and reports archive

Go to your Quilt web-based catalog administration panel, "Status"
tab (under the /admin/status URL).
There you can see the stack's current operational status (as well
as the chart with historic data for the last month) and the reports
table (which can be sorted / filtered) where you can preview or
download stored reports (HTML files).

![Status overview](../imgs/catalog-status-overview.png)

### Getting notifications about canary failures

For convenience, the following canary-related events are forwarded
to an SNS topic (available as `CanaryNotificationsTopic` in the
Quilt instance CloudFormation deployment Outputs tab):

1. A canary entering error state
2. A canary run failure

Quilt administrators can subscribe to this SNS topic to receive
these event notifications and process them appropriately (e.g. notifying first
responders or sending to incident management systems).

If enabled (see set-up instructions above), these events will be
also sent as emails to the configured address (`CanaryNotificationsEmail`
CloudFormation template parameter).

## Audit Trail

Audit trails enable you to track which users had which permissions at which time.
While data access to S3 is logged via CloudTrail, certain "admin plane" events
such as the following are logged to a managed S3 bucket and exposed
via an Athena table:

- A user logs into the Catalog
- A user role is changed
- A user is added, deleted, or inactivated in the Catalog

### Audit events

Audit events are stored as JSON records in JSONL files in a managed audit trail
S3 bucket.

#### Event structure

- `eventVersion: str`, (required, since 1.0)

  Version of the event record.

- `eventTime: datetime` (required, since 1.0)

  When the action was **completed** (in UTC).

- `eventID: str` (required, since 1.0)

  A unique ID (UUID) of the event.

- `eventSource: "QuiltServer" | "QuiltScript"` (required, since 1.0)

  The service or part of the system that this event originates from.

- `eventType: "QuiltApiCall" | "QuiltScriptInvocation"` (required, since 1.0)

  The type of event that generated the event record.

- `eventName: str` (required, since 1.0)

  The name of action performed in the form `${namespace}.${operationName}`,
  e.g. `Users.Create`. See [Event Taxonomy](#event-taxonomy) for details.

- `userAgent: str` (optional, since 1.0)

  The agent through which the request was made, such as a web browser,
  a Quilt Stack or Quilt Python Client.

- `sourceIPAddress: str` (optional, since 1.0)

  The IP address that the request was made from.

- `userIdentity: UserIdentity` (required, since 1.0)

  Information about the identity that performed the action.
  Refer to [UserIdentity](#user-identity) section below for details.

- `requestID: str` (optional, since 1.0)

  Request ID based on
  [AWS ALB request tracing capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-request-tracing.html).

- `requestParameters: object` (required, since 1.0)

  The parameters, if any, that were sent with the request.
  These parameters are documented under [Event Taxonomy](#event-taxonomy) section.

- `responseElements: any` (optional, since 1.0)

  The response data, if any.

- `errorCode: str` (optional, since 1.0)

  Only present if an error occurred while trying to perform an action,
  `null` when the action succeeds.

- `errorMessage: str` (optional, since 1.0)

  Description of the error.

- `additionalEventData: object` (optional, since 1.0)

  Additional data about the event that was not part of the request or response.

#### Event source and type

When a Quilt Server API is called (GraphQL query or HTTP endpoint),
`eventSource` is set to `QuiltServer` and `eventType` -- to `QuiltApiCall`.

When an admin script is invoked (this usually happens on stack bring-up / upgrade),
`eventSource` is set to `QuiltScript` and `eventType` -- to `QuiltScriptInvocation`.

#### Event schema versioning

Event records are versioned using SemVer-like versioning scheme (`MAJOR.MINOR`).

`MAJOR` version is incremented on backwards-incompatible changes to the schema,
e.g. removing a JSON field that already exists, or changing how the contents of
a field are represented (for example, a date format).

`MINOR` version is incremented on backwards-compatible changes, such as adding
new fields to the event structure.

#### GraphQL requests

For GraphQL requests,
query (mutation) parameters are recorded as `requestParameters`,
and response data (respecting the selection set) are recorded as `responseElements`.
Errors are inferred and recorded to `errorCode` / `errorMessage`.

#### User Identity

All `UserIdentity` variants are stored as JSON objects with a required `type` field.
Other fields vary based on the type of the recorded user identity.

##### `QuiltUser`

Represents an authenticated Quilt User.

**Attributes**:

- `type: "QuiltUser"`

- `dateJoined: datetime`
- `roleId: str` (optional) - An ID of the associated Quilt Role.

##### `Unidentified`

Represents a user we were unable to identify.

In `QuiltApiCall` actions, this means an anonymous (unauthenticated) user,
e.g. we can't identify a user trying to sign-in with a non-registered username.

In `QuiltScript` actions, this means the execution environment doesn't have
AWS credentials available -- this shouldn't happen in our production installations.

**Attributes**:

- `type: "Unidentified"`

##### `IAMUser`

### Querying With Athena

Audit events can be queried with [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).
Quilt Stack provisions the following resources:

- **Audit Trail Database**: a Glue database named `audittraildatabase-${random_string}`,
  exposed as `AuditTrailDatabase` stack resource.

- **Audit Trail Table**: a Glue table named `audit_trail` in
  **Audit Trail Database**.

- **Audit Workgroup**: an Athena workgroup named `${AWS::StackName}-audit`,
  exposed as `AuditTrailWorkgroup` stack resource.

- **Audit Trail Bucket**: an S3 bucket storing all the audit trail data and
  Athena query results for **Audit Workgroup**.

- **Audit Trail Query Policy**: a managed IAM policy allowing to query
  audit trail data via Athena, exposed as `AuditTrailAthenaQueryPolicy` stack
  resource.

In order to query audit trail data via AWS Athena Console, you should:

1. Ensure you have adequate permissions to query the data
   (e.g. use the Quilt-managed **Audit Trail Query Policy**).

1. Select `AwsDataCatalog` from the "Data source" dropdown.

1. Select **Audit Trail Database** from the "Database" dropdown.

1. Select **Audit Workgroup** from the "Workgroup" dropdown.

All the events are available in the `audit_trail` table,
which has the following fields (schema version 1.0):

- `eventversion: string`
- `eventtime: timestamp`
- `eventid: string`
- `eventsource: string`
- `eventtype: string`
- `eventname: string`
- `useragent: string`
- `sourceipaddress: string`
- `useridentity: string`
- `requestparameters: string`
- `responseelements: string`
- `errorcode: string`
- `errormessage: string`
- `additionaleventdata: string`
- `requestid: string`
- `date: string` (partition)

The data is partitioned by `date`, which has `YYYY/mm/dd` format.
[Partitioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/ctas-partitioning-and-bucketing.html#ctas-partitioning-and-bucketing-what-is-partitioning)
helps to make the queries faster and cheaper by reducing the amount of data scanned,
so it's advised to always filter by the partition key when possible.

All the JSON objects from an event record are exposed to Athena as strings,
so you can leverage athena JSON querying capabilities.

#### Example queries

When did a user with the specified email last log in?

```sql
SELECT
eventtime,
useragent,
sourceipaddress,
useridentity,
requestparameters,
responseelements,
additionaleventdata
FROM audit_trail
WHERE eventname = 'Auth.Login'
AND errorcode IS NULL
AND json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.type') = 'QuiltUser'
AND json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.email') = 'example@quiltdata.io'
ORDER BY eventtime DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Example query result:

|`eventtime`|`useragent`|`sourceipaddress`|`useridentity`|`requestparameters`|`responseelements`|`additionaleventdata`|
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
|`2023-06-08 13:59:36.000`|`Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/113.0`|*REDACTED*|`{"isssoonly":false,"isadmin":true,"lastlogin":"2023-03-23T12:37:53Z","roleid":"*REDACTED*","isactive":true,"isservice":false,"id":"*REDACTED*","type":"QuiltUser","datejoined":"2020-11-16T03:32:01Z","email":"example@quiltdata.io","username":"example"}`|`{"password":"***","username":"example"}`|`{"access_token":"***","refresh_token":"***","exp":"2023-09-06T13:59:36Z"}`|`{"method":"password"}`|

What are all the actions performed by a user with the given email today
and which IP did they come from?

```sql
SELECT
eventtime,
eventname,
useragent,
sourceipaddress,
requestparameters,
responseelements,
additionaleventdata,
errorcode
FROM audit_trail
WHERE date = date_format(current_date, '%Y/%m/%d')
AND json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.type') = 'QuiltUser'
AND json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.email') = 'example@quiltdata.io'
ORDER BY eventtime
```

Example query result:

|`eventtime`|`eventname`|`useragent`|`sourceipaddress`|`requestparameters`|`responseelements`|`additionaleventdata`|`errorcode`|

Which users were active this month and what actions they performed?

```sql
SELECT
json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.id') as userid,
array_agg(DISTINCT json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.username')) as usernames,
array_agg(DISTINCT json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.email')) as emails,
array_agg(DISTINCT json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.isadmin')) as isadmin_values,
array_agg(DISTINCT json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.roleid')) as roles,
array_agg(DISTINCT sourceipaddress) as ips,
min(eventtime) as time_first,

array_agg(DISTINCT eventname) as actions
FROM audit_trail
WHERE date BETWEEN date_format(current_date, '%Y/%m/01') AND date_format(current_date, '%Y/%m/31')
AND json_extract_scalar(useridentity, '$.type') = 'QuiltUser'
