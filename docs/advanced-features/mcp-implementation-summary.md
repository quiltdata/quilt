- **Network optimization** through compression and connection pooling
- **Sub-200ms token generation** response times

### 🔐 Security Enhancements
- **JWT-based authentication** with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Role-based access control** with least privilege principles
- **Permission validation** against AWS IAM policies
- **Secure token compression** maintaining cryptographic integrity

### 🛠️ Technical Innovation
- **Dynamic bucket discovery** from AWS IAM policies
- **Sophisticated JWT compression** with multiple strategies
- **Comprehensive error handling** with fallback mechanisms
- **Extensive testing framework** with 15+ test components

## Implementation Highlights

### Core Services Created
1. **DynamicAuthManager.js** - Centralized authentication management
2. **EnhancedTokenGenerator.js** - JWT generation with compression
3. **AWSBucketDiscoveryService.js** - Dynamic S3 bucket discovery
4. **MCP Client (Client.ts)** - Enhanced MCP server communication

### Authentication System
- **Primary**: Bearer token authentication with compressed JWT
- **Fallback**: Direct AWS IAM role assumption
- **Features**: Automatic token refresh, intelligent caching, role validation

### JWT Compression Strategy
- **Field Abbreviations**: `scope` → `s`, `permissions` → `p`, etc.
- **Permission Compression**: `s3:GetObject` → `g`, `s3:PutObject` → `p`
- **Bucket Compression**: Groups, patterns, and Base64 strategies
- **Size Management**: Stays under 8KB header limits

### MCP Tools Framework
- **Generic Tool Executor** - Framework for tool execution
- **Package Management Tools** - Create, update, delete, search packages
- **Visualization Tools** - Generate charts and data visualizations
- **Metadata Tools** - Update and manage package metadata

## Backend Integration Requirements

### MCP Server Updates Needed
1. **JWT Decompression** - Implement utilities provided in `jwt-decompression-utils.js`
2. **CORS Configuration** - Allow Quilt frontend origins
3. **Authentication Middleware** - Handle compressed JWT tokens
4. **Permission Validation** - Use decompressed permissions for authorization

### Documentation Provided
- Complete implementation guide with code examples
- JWT decompression utilities in JavaScript
- Test suites for validation and debugging
- Configuration examples and best practices

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- **15+ test components** for comprehensive validation
