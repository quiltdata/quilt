## How do I sync my notebook and all of its data and models to S3 as a package?
```
p = quilt3.Package()
p.set_dir(".", ".")
p.push("USR/PKG", message="MSG", registry="s3://BUCKET")
```
> Use a [.quiltignore file](https://docs.quiltdata.com/advanced-usage/.quiltignore)
for more control over which files `set_dir()` includes.

## How does Quilt versioning relate to S3 object versioning?
Quilt packages are one level of abstraction above S3 object versions.
Object versions track mutations to a single file,
whereas a quilt package references a *collection* files and assigns this collection a unique version.

It is strongly recommended that you enable object versioning on the S3 buckets
that you push Quilt packages to.
Object versioning ensures that mutations to every object are tracked,
and provides some protection against deletion.

## Where are the Quilt 2 packages?
Visit [legacy.quiltdata.com](https://legacy.quiltdata.com/)
and use [`quilt`](https://pypi.org/project/quilt/) on PyPI.

## Does `quilt3` collect anonymous usage statistics?
Yes, to find bugs and prioritize features.

You can disable anonymous usage collection with an environment variable:
```
$ export QUILT_DISABLE_USAGE_METRICS=true
```

Or call `quilt3.disable_telemetry()`
to persistently disable anonymous usage statistics.

## Can I turn off TQDM progress bars for log files?

Yes:
```
$ export QUILT_MINIMIZE_STDOUT=true
```

## Which version of Quilt are you on?

### Python client
```bash
quilt3 --version
```

### CloudFormation application
1. Go to CloudFormation > Stacks > YourQuiltStack > Outputs
1. Copy the row labeled TemplateBuildMetadata
1. "git_revision" is your template version

## Hashing takes a long time. Can I speed it up?

Yes. Follow these steps:

1. Run your compute in the same region as your S3 bucket (as opposed to
a local machine or foreign region)â€”I/O is much faster.

1. Use a larger instance with more vCPUs.

1. Increase [`QUILT_TRANSFER_MAX_CONCURRENCY`](api-reference/cli.md#quilt_transfer_max_concurrency)
above its default to match your available vCPUs.

## I'm having trouble pushing packages from inside of a notebook

Since `quilt3.Package.push` displays progress bars, we recommended one of the
following:

1. Push from outside your notebook with the CLI (`quilt3 push ....`). You can
use Jupyter terminal for this.

1. If you must push from within the notebook, save it first, and use the `%%capture`
magic to prevent output from cells that change during push. This prevents a race
condition between hashing the file and physically copying it to S3, during which
time the file hash and size might change, due to progress bars and other text
that `quilt3` writes to your notebook. Failing this precaution, `quilt3 install`
may fail since the file in S3 contains may have a different hash than your local
machine did when `push` began.
