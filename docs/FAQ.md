## How do I sync my notebook and all of its data and models to S3 as a package?
```
p = quilt3.Package()
p.set_dir(".", ".")
p.push("USR/PKG", message="MSG", registry="s3://BUCKET")
```
> Use a [.quiltignore file](https://docs.quiltdata.com/advanced-usage/.quiltignore)
for more control over which files `set_dir()` includes.

## How does Quilt versioning relate to S3 object versioning?
Quilt packages are one level of abstraction above S3 object versions.
Object versions track mutations to a single file,
whereas a quilt package references a *collection* files and assigns this collection a unique version.

It is strongly recommended that you enable object versioning on the S3 buckets
that you push Quilt packages to.
Object versioning ensures that mutations to every object are tracked,
and provides some protection against deletion.

## Where are the Quilt 2 packages?
Visit [legacy.quiltdata.com](https://legacy.quiltdata.com/)
and use [`quilt`](https://pypi.org/project/quilt/) on PyPI.

## Does `quilt3` collect anonymous usage statistics?
Yes, to find bugs and prioritize features.

You can disable anonymous usage collection with an environment variable:
```
$ export QUILT_DISABLE_USAGE_METRICS=true
```

Or call `quilt3.disable_telemetry()`
to persistently disable anonymous usage statistics.

## Can I turn off TQDM progress bars for log files?

Yes:
```
$ export QUILT_MINIMIZE_STDOUT=true
```

If you recently added the bucket or upgraded the stack, if search volume is high,
or if the bucket is under rapid modification, wait a few minutes and try again.

### Re-index the bucket

1. Open the bucket in the Quilt catalog

1. Click the gear icon (upper right), or navigate to Users and buckets > Buckets
and open the bucket in question
    ![](imgs/admin-bucket.png)

1. Under "Indexing and notifications", click "Re-index and Repair". Optional:
if and only if bucket notifications were deleted or are not working,
check "Repair S3 notifications".

1. Wait a few minutes while bucket statistics and packages repopulate

### Diagnose issues with ElasticSearch

1. Go to CloudFormation > Stacks > YourQuiltStack > Resources
1. Search for "domain"
1. Click on the link for "Search" under "Physical ID"
1. You are now under ElasticSearch > Dashboards
1. Set the time range to include the period before and after when you noticed
any issues
1. Screenshot the dashboard stats for your domain
1. Click into your domain and then navigate to "Cluster health"
1. Screenshot Summary, Overall Health, and Key Performance Indicator sections
1. Send screenshots to [Quilt support](mailto:support@quiltdata.io).
1. It is not recommended that you adjust ElasticSearch via Edit domain, as these
changes will be lost the next time that you update Quilt

## Which version of Quilt are you on?

1. Go to CloudFormation > Stacks > YourQuiltStack > Outputs
1. Copy the row labeled TemplateBuildMetadata
1. "git_revision" is your template version
