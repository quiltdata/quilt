# Background
* **package handles**
  * Packages are referenced by a handle of the form `OWNER/NAME`
  * Teams packages include a prefix, `TEAM:OWNER/NAME`
* **READMEs** 
  * A `README.md` is recommended at the root of your package. README files support [full markdown syntax via remarkable](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/). READMEs are rendered to HTML on the [package landing page](https://quiltdata.com/package/danWebster/sgRNAs).
* **Short hashes**
  * Commands that take hashes support "short hashes", up to uniqueness. In practice, 6-8 characters is sufficient to achieve uniqueness.
  ```sh
  quilt install akarve/examples -x 4594b5
  # matches hash 4594b58d64dd9c98b79b628370618031c66e80cbbd1db48662be0b7cac36a74e
  ```
* **Requirements file (quilt.yml)**
  ```sh
  $ quilt install [@FILENAME]
  # quilt.yml is the default if @filename is absent
  ```
  * Installs a list of packages specified by a YAML file. The YAML file must contain a `packages` node with a list of packages: 
  ```yaml
    packages:
      - USER/PACKAGE[/SUBPACKAGE][:h[ash]|:t[ag]|:v[ersion]][:HASH|TAG|VERSION]
  ```
  * Example
  ```
  packages:
    - vgauthier/DynamicPopEstimate   # get latest
    - danWebster/sgRNAs:a972d92      # get a specific version via hash
    - akarve/sales:tag:latest        # get a specific version via tag
    - asah/snli:v:1.0                # get a specific version via version
  ```

# API

## Team users
See [teams docs](./teams.md) for additional commands and syntax.

## Core: build, push, and install packages
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt build USER/PACKAGE PATH` | `quilt.build("USER/PACKAGE", "PATH")` | `PATH` may be a `build.yml` file or a directory. If a directory is given, Quilt will internally generate a build file (useful, e.g. for directories of images). `build.yml` is for users who want fine-grained control over parsing. |
| `quilt push USER/PACKAGE [--public ￨ --team]` | `quilt.push("USER/PACKAGE", is_public=False, is_team=False)` | Stores the package in the registry |
| `quilt install USER/PACKAGE[/SUBPATH/...] [-x HASH ￨ -t TAG ￨ -v VERSION]` | `quilt.install("USER/PACKAGE[/SUBPATH/...]", hash="HASH", tag="TAG", version="VERSION")` | Installs a package or sub-package |
| `quilt install @FILE=quilt.yml` | Not supported | Installs all specified packages using the requirements syntax (above) |
| `quilt delete USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.delete("USER/PACKAGE")` | Removes the package from the registry. Does not delete local data. |

## Versioning
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt log USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.log(USER/PACKAGE)` | Display push history |
| `quilt version list USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.version_list(USER/PACKAGE)` | Display versions of a package |
| `quilt version add USER/PACKAGE VERSION HASH` | `quilt.version_add(USER/PACKAGE, VERSION, HASH)` |  Associate a version with a hash |
| `quilt tag list USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.tag_list(USER/PACKAGE)` | List available tags |
| `quilt tag add USER/PACKAGE TAG HASH` |`quilt.tag_add(USER/PACKAGE, TAG, HASH)` | Associate a tag with a hash |
| `quilt tag remove USER/PACKAGE TAG` | `quilt.tag_remove(USER/PACKAGE, TAG)` | Remove a tag |

### Instances, hashes, tags, and versions
* A package _instance_ is a package handle plus a hash. `akarve/sales:fc7f0b` is an instance. Instances are immutable.
* _Hashes_ are automatically generated by Quilt for each package build.
* _Tags_ are human-readable strings associated with a package instance. Tags can be altered to point to different instances of the same package. The most recent build is automatically tagged `"latest"`.
* _Versions_ are human-readable strings associated with a package instance. Unlike tags, versions can only ever point to a single package instance.

## Access
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt login [TEAM]` | `quilt.login(["TEAM"])` | Authenticate to a registry |
| `quilt access list USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.access_list("USER/PACKAGE")` | List user who have access to a package |
| `quilt access add USER/PACKAGE USER_OR_GROUP` |  `quilt.access_add("USER/PACKAGE", "USER_OR_GROUP")` | Grant read access to a user or group (one of `public` or `team`) |
| `quilt access remove USER_OR_GROUP` | `quilt.access_remove("USER/PACKAGE", "USER_OR_GROUP")` | Remove read access |

## Local storage
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt ls` | `quilt.ls()` | List installed packages |
| `quilt rm USER/PACKAGE` | `quilt.rm("USER/PACKAGE")` | Remove a package from local storage (but not from the registry) |

## Registry search
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt search "SEARCH STRING"` |  `quilt.search("SEARCH STRING")` | Search registry for packages by user or package name |

## Export a package or subpackage
| Command line | Python | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quilt export USER/PACKAGE` |  `quilt.export("USER/PACKAGE")` | Export data to current dir |
| `quilt export USER/PACKAGE DEST` |  `quilt.export("USER/PACKAGE", "DEST")` | Export data to specified destination |

## Import and use data
For a package in the public cloud:
```python
from quilt.data.USER import PACKAGE
```
For a package in a team registry:
```python
from quilt.team.TEAM_NAME.USER import PACKAGE
```

## Using packages
Packages contain three types of nodes:
* `PackageNode` - the root of the package tree
* `GroupNode` - like a folder; may contain one or more `GroupNode` or `DataNode` objects
* `DataNode` - a leaf node in the package; contains actual data

### Working with package contents
* List node contents with dot notation: `PACKAGE.NODE.ANOTHER_NODE`
* Retrieve the contents of a `DataNode` with `_data()`, or simply `()`: `PACKAGE.NODE.ANOTHER_NODE()`
  * Columnar data (`XLS`, `CSV`, `TSV`, etc.) returns as a `pandas.DataFrame`
  * All other data types return a string to the path of the object in the package store

### Enumerating package contents
* `quilt.inspect("USER/PACKAGE")` shows package columns, types, and shape
* `NODE._keys()` returns a list of all children
* `NODE._data_keys()` returns a list of all data children (leaf nodes containing actual data)
* `NODE._group_keys()` returns a list of all group children (groups are like folders)
* `NODE._items()` returns a generator of the node's children as (name, node) pairs.

#### Example
```
from quilt.data.uciml import wine
In [7]: wine._keys()
Out[7]: ['README', 'raw', 'tables']
In [8]: wine._data_keys()
Out[8]: ['README']
In [9]: wine._group_keys()
Out[9]: ['raw', 'tables']
```

### Editing Package Contents
* `PACKAGENODE._set(PATH, VALUE)` sets a child node. `PATH` is an array of strings, one for each level of the tree. `VALUE` is the new value. If it's a Pandas dataframe, it will be serialized. A string will be interpreted as a path to a file that contains the data to be packaged. Common columnar formats will be serialized into data frames. All other file formats, e.g. images, will be copied as-is.
* `GROUPNODE._add_group(NAME)` adds an empty `GroupNode` with the given name to the children of `GROUPNODE`.

#### Example
```
import pandas as pd
import quilt
quilt.build('USER/PKG') # create new, empty packckage
from quilt.data.USER import PKG as pkg
pkg._set(['data'], pd.DataFrame(data=[1, 2, 3]))
pkg._set(['foo'], "example.txt")
quilt.build('USER/PKG', pkg)
```
This adds a child node named `data` to the new empty package, with the new DataFrame as its value. Then it adds the contents of `example.txt` to a node called `foo`. Finally, it commits this change to disk by building the package with the modified object.


See [the examples repo](https://github.com/quiltdata/examples) for additional usage examples.
