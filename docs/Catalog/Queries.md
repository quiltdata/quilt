## ElasticSearch

The objects in S3 buckets connected to Quilt are synchronized to an ElasticSearch
cluster, which powers Quilt's search features. For custom queries, you can use the
Queries tab in the Quilt catalog to directly query ElasticSearch cluster.

Quilt uses ElasticsSearch 6.7
([docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/index.html)).

- `body` — the search query body as a JSON dictionary ([learn more](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-body.html))

### Saved queries
You can provide pre-canned queries for your users by providing a configuration file 
at `s3://YOUR_BUCKET/.quilt/queries/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1"
queries:
  query-1:
    name: My first query
    description: Optional description
    url: s3://BUCKET/.quilt/queries/query-1.json
  query-2:
    name: Second query
    url: s3://BUCKET/.quilt/queries/query-2.json
```

The Quilt catalog displays your saved queries in a drop-down for your users to
select, edit, and execute.
