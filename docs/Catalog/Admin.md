The Quilt catalog includes an admin panel that allows you to manage users and buckets in your stack and to customize your Quilt catalog.
You can access it via a dropdown menu opened by clicking your username in the navbar.

The admin page is only accessible to catalog admins.
Only admins may create other admins, and the catalog enforces a constraint that
there must always be at least one admin account on the catalog
(a default one is created as part of the catalog standup process).


## Users and roles

This section provides comprehensive access control management.
