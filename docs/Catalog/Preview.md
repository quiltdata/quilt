The Quilt catalog renders previews of the following file types.
Whenever possible, Quilt streams the smallest possible subset of the data
needed to generate the preview.

Previews are supported for uncompressed files as well as for gzip archives (.gz).

## Plain text previews
Quilt can display any plaintext file format, including the following. 

* Most programming languages, with syntax highlighting
(.cpp, .json, .js, .py, .sh,  .sql, etc.)
* Biological file formats (.bed, .cef, .gff, .fasta, .fastq, .sam, .pdbqt, .vcf, etc.)
* Text files (.csv, .md, .readme, .tsv, .txt, etc.)

## Chemical structures
The Quilt catalog uses the [NGL Viewer library](https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl) to render structures.
By default, v3000 Molfiles are converted to v2000 by the JavaScript client for rendering.

The following file formats are supported:
* Mol files (.mol, .mol2, .sdf)
* .cif
* .ent
* .pdb

## Binary and special file format previews
* Excel (.xls, .xlsx)
* FCS Flow Cytometry files (.fcs)
* Images (.gif, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, etc.)
* Media (.mp4, .webm, .flac, .m2t, .mp3, .mp4, .ogg, .ts, .tsa, .tsv, .wav)
* .ipynb (Jupyter and Voila dashboards)
* .parquet
