You can securely and privately run the Quilt catalog in "single-player mode" on your machine.
`quilt3 catalog` launches a Python webserver and local services
that communicate with S3 using temporary AWS credentials,
derived from your default AWS credentials
(or active `AWS_PROFILE`) with `boto3.sts.get_session_token`.
Data and credentials remain local and private to your machine and AWS account.

For more details about configuring and using AWS credentials in `boto3`,
see the [AWS documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install quilt3[catalog]
```

## Invocation

```bash
$ quilt3 catalog
```

See the [CLI API reference](../api-reference/cli.md#catalog) for details.
