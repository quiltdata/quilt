`Qurator Omni` is an always-available AI assistant embedded directly into the
Quilt web catalog. It allows users to interact with S3 buckets and search
functionality through natural language. Qurator Omni leverages advanced models
like Claude, integrated via Amazon Bedrock, enabling users to query, retrieve,
and summarize data instead of having to click through the GUI.

Qurator Omni is designed to streamline interaction with Quilt data by offering a
conversational interface. Instead of navigating through various tabs and menus,
or learning complicated search syntax, users can opt into the Qurator feature to
ask complex questions in plain language and receive structured, actionable
responses.

For example, users can ask for summaries of research on topics like "melanoma"
or request key insights from a specific dataset.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex questions like “What are the latest
  asthma treatments?” or “Summarize research on BRCA1 mutations.”
- **Instant Summaries**: Quickly digest scientific papers, datasets, or reports
  without reading everything.
- **Fine-Grained Permissions with RAG**: Ensure Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  only queries the data you're authorized to access, ensuring compliance with
  strict organizational policies
- **Secure Cloud Environment**: Work within your private AWS cloud, ensuring
  data stays secure while using state-of-the-art AI models.

## Getting Started

To enable Qurator Omni:

1. **Opt-In to Qurator**:  
   - Install Release 1.55 or later of the Quilt Platform CloudFormation template.
   - Set the `Qurator` parameter to `Enabled` in the CloudFormation template to
     enable the Qurator chatbot.

2. **Configure Claude Model**:  
   - Login to the Amazon Bedrock console.
   - Ensure that the Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2
     (`anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`) inference profile is
     available in the same region as your Quilt deployment. Check [Model support
     by AWS
     Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-regions.html)
     for details.
   - Enable the model by configuring it within your Bedrock environment.
   - Carefully monitor the model’s cost implications. The Claude model is
     charged based on usage, so ensure that you have the necessary budget
     allocated. Initial estimates are roughly a penny per page for complex documents.

3. **Start Using Qurator**:  
   - Once activated, the Qurator chatbot will appear in the Quilt web catalog
     interface.
   - Click the Qurator icon on the
     bottom right of the screen to open the chat interface. ![qurator icon](../imgs/qurator-icon.png)
   - You can begin by typing questions into the chat interface. For example,
     queries like _“What are the key findings on small molecule delivery?”_ will
     prompt Qurator to search for relevant data and present a summarized
     overview.

### Example Use Cases

- **Search**: _“What are the latest papers on melanoma?”_  
  Qurator will search through the Quilt catalog using Elastic Search and
  retrieve the most relevant data.
  
- **Summarize**: _“Summarize the key points of this BRCA1 research.”_  
  After selecting a specific document, Qurator will generate a clear, useful
  summary of the paper.

- **Quick Scan**: _“List some of the authors doing breast cancer research?”_  
  Qurator Omni will list authors and their contributions based on Quilt’s
  indexed datasets.

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Productivity**: Eliminate the need for manual search navigation,
  enabling faster access to critical information.
- **Improved Insights**: Gain deeper insights from large datasets with automatic
  summaries.
- **Streamlined Collaboration**: Leveraging AI chat to provide background and
  context when working across disciplines.
