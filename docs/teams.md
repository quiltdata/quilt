# Teams (BETA)

A Quilt team is a single-tenant, dedicated registry with a private package namespace. As a team member, you can read and write packages from the team namespace.

Quilt teams include a special administrative interface for auditing data access, adding, and removing users.

The syntax for a team package handle is `TEAM:USER/PKG`.

If you'd like to use Quilt teams, [contact us](sales@quiltdata.io) to join the Beta.

# Command line API
Team users can have access to the [standard API](./api.md) with the following differences and additional administrative features.

## Core API differences
