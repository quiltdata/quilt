Each Quilt stack includes an Elasticsearch cluster that indexes
objects and packages as documents. You can connect to your Elasticsearch
domain to query these documents.

> If your Quilt stack uses private endpoints for Elasticsearch you will need to
> connect to the cluster from a machine in the same VPC as the cluster.

Each Amazon S3 bucket connected to Quilt implies two Elasticsearch index aliases:
1. `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME`: Contains one document per object in the bucket.
2. `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_packages`: Contains one document per package revision in the bucket.

> Quilt uses Amazon Elasticsearch version 6.7.

## Query Elasticsearch with Python

You can use [`elasticsearch
6.3.1`](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.1/) as
follows:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```python
from aws_requests_auth.boto_utils import BotoAWSRequestsAuth
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch, RequestsHttpConnection

es_host = "check.aws.console.for.your.host.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"

auth = BotoAWSRequestsAuth(
    aws_host=es_host,
    aws_region='us-east-1',
    aws_service='es'
)

elastic = Elasticsearch(
    hosts=[
        {"host": f"{es_host}", "port": 443}
    ],
    http_auth=auth,
    use_ssl=True,
    verify_certs=True,
    connection_class=RequestsHttpConnection,
    timeout=27
)

query = rbody = {
    "query": {
        # query body here
    }
}

elastic.search(
    index="*_packages", # search all package indexes in this stack
    body=rbody,
    _source=['*'], # return all document fields
    size=1000,
)
```
