# Teams

Quilt Teams offer enhanced security, auditing, and privacy. Only team members can read and write data to and from the team. Teams are controlled by one or more admins who have access to a special web interface where they can audit data usage, add new members, and more.

Technically, a Quilt team is a dedicated, single-tenant registry with a private package namespace. Teams also feature their own web catalog (accessible only to team members), similar to [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com).

To create your own Quilt team, [contact Quilt](sales@quiltdata.io).

## Command line API
Team members have access to the [standard command line API](./api.md) with the following differences and additional features.

### `quilt login`
Authenticate to  team registry:
```
quilt login TEAM
``` 

### `quilt build|push|install`
Team users should prefix package handles with the team namespace:
```
quilt build|push|install TEAM:USER/PKG
```

### `quilt push` visibility
* `quilt push --team` makes a package visible to everyone on your team
* ~~`quilt push --public`~~ is currently disabled for team packages

### `quilt access`
To make a package visible to your entire team:
```
