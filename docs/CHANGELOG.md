PR https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/pull/290

# 2.8.0 - 2017-12-07 - Centralized Local Package Store
# Release Highlights

## Quilt packages live in a centralized location on your machine
Quilt data packages are now available wherever you run Python. We recommend that users **quilt push all local packages to the registry before upgrading**. Further details on migration are [here](https://docs.quiltdata.com/troubleshooting.html).

## Faster builds with build cache
Quilt now caches build intermediates. So if you wish to update the README of a multi-gigabyte package, you can rebuild the entire package in one second. 

## Group-level build parameters
You can now specify build parameters (like transform) for all children of a group in one shot. The updated syntax and docs are [here](https://docs.quiltdata.com/buildyml.html).

## quilt.yml is like requirments.txt but for data
You can now express dependencies on multiple packages in a single file. Docs [here](https://docs.quiltdata.com/cli.html#installing-via-requirements-file).

## Experimental: build a package from a GitHub repo
Quilt build now accepts GitHub URLs. If you use data stored on GitHub you can turn it into a Quilt package with quilt build.

# 2.7.1 - 2017-11-09 - Checks: unit tests for data packages
Version 2.7.1 includes several minor bug fixes and one new feature, checks. Checks allow a user to specify data integrity checks that are enforced during quilt build.

# 2.6.1 - 2017-07-20 - Package Delete
This release adds a new command to delete a package including all versions and history from the registry.

# 2.6.0 - 2017-07-14 - Fast Builds for Large Packages
Building a package from a directory of input files now skips generating a build file. That speeds up the build process and makes it easier to change the package contents and rebuild.

# 2.5.1 - 2017-07-06 - Push Public Packages
This release includes support for paid plans on quiltdata.com and is recommended for all individual and business-plan users. It adds a shortcut to push packages and make them public in a single command and improves documentation.
