## Catalog Overview stats (objects, packages) seem incorrect or aren't updating

## Catalog Packages tab doesn't work

## Catalog packages or stats are missing or are not updating

These are all symptoms of the same underlying issue: the Elasticsearch index is
out of sync. If any of the following are true, please wait a few minutes and try
again:

- you recently added the bucket or upgraded the stack
- search volume is high, or
- read/write volume is high

If that doesn't work, try the following steps:

### Re-index the bucket

If you have less than 1 million objects in the bucket, you should re-index the
bucket:

1. Open the bucket overview in the Quilt catalog and click the gear icon (upper
right), or navigate to Admin settings > Buckets and inspect the settings of the
bucket in question.

1. Under "Indexing and notifications", click "Re-index and Repair".

> Optionally: **if and only if** bucket notifications are not working and you
> are certain that there are no other subscribers to the S3 Events of the bucket
> in question, check "Repair S3 notifications".

Bucket packages, stats, and the search index will repopulate in the next few
minutes.

However, if you have more than 1 million objects in the bucket, re-indexing will
take much longer and potentially become expensive.  In that case, please try the
below steps. If those do not work, please contact [Quilt
support](mailto:support@quiltdata.io).

### Inspect the Elasticsearch domain

1. Determine your Quilt instance's ElasticSearch domain from Amazon Console >
OpenSearch or `aws opensearch list-domain-names`. Note the domain name
(hereafter `QUILT_DOMAIN`).

1. Run the following command and save the output file:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name "$QUILT_DOMAIN"\
      > quilt-es-domain.json
    ```

1. Visit Amazon Console > OpenSearch > `QUILT_DOMAIN` > Cluster health.

1. Set the time range as long as possible to fully overlap with your observed
   issues.

1. Screenshot the Summary, Overall Health, and Key Performance Indicator
   sections

1. Send the JSON output file and screenshots to [Quilt
   support](mailto:support@quiltdata.io).

> As a rule you should **not** reconfigure your Elasticsearch domain directly as
> this will result in stack drift that will be lost the next time you update
> your Quilt instance.

## Missing metadata when working with Quilt packages via the API

> `Package.set_dir()` on the package root (".") overrides package-level
> metadata. If you do not provide `set_dir(".", foo, meta=baz)` with a value for
> `meta=`, `set_dir` will set package-level metadata to `None`.

A common pattern is to `Package.browse()` to get the most recent
version of a package, and then `Package.push()` updates.
You can preserve package-level metadata when calling `set_dir(".", ...)`
as follows:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```python
import quilt3

p = quilt3.Package.browse(
    "user-packages/geodata", 
    registry="s3://bucket_1"
)

p.set_dir(
    ".",
    "s3://bucket_2/path/to/new/geofiles",
    meta=p.meta
)

# Push changes to the S3 registry
p.push(
    "user-packages/geodata",
    registry="s3://bucket_1",
    message="Updating package geodata source data"
)
```

- [Reference](https://docs.quiltdata.com/api-reference/package#package.set_dir).

## "Session expired" notice in the Catalog

There are two reasons for encountering the "Session expired" notice
after clicking the `RELOAD` button in the Quilt Catalog.

1. Your browser cache is out of date, in which case you need to:
    1. Delete session storage
    1. Delete local storage
    1. Delete cookies
1. Your Quilt user Role has been corrupted. You will need a Quilt Admin
user to reset your Quilt user Role to a default (**and valid**) Role.

## User creation and log in

Users can either be invited directly or are _just-in-time provisioned (JIP)_
when they sign in via SSO and receive the "default role."

### Important conditions and pre-requisites

- If an admin (or any user) is created by JIP, or created through CloudFormation
with an SSO Provider set to anything other than Disabled, then setting the
password for that user has no effect and _password login will never succeed_ for
that user. Said another way, users created through SSO can only log in through
SSO.

- You _must disable SSO_ and enable `PasswordAuth` if you wish to log in as an
admin using a password (as opposed to SSO).

### Unable to log in

The following are common causes of failed logins. In most cases we recommend
that you check the [network panel of your browser](#browser-network-and-console)
for details.

1. SSO connector misconfigured. See [SSO](technical-reference.md#cnames) for
   details.
1. SSL errors are often caused by misspelled names, or incomplete Subject
Alternate Names. The ACM certificate for `CertificateArnELB` must cover all
three Quilt [CNAMEs](technical-reference.md#cnames) either via a suitable `*` or
explicit Subject Alternate Names.

### Changing the admin email or password

Changing the admin password is only possible with `PasswordAuth=Enabled` in
CloudFormation and is subject to the following limitations for security reasons:

- Has no effect if SSO is in use, or was in use when the admin was first
  created.
- Has no effect on pre-existing admin username/password pairs.

You can click "reset password" on the login page.

To change the admin email (e.g. you have accidentally broken your admin user)
try the following:

1. Change the value of the `AdminEmail` CloudFormation parameter _to a net new
   email_.
1. Apply the change as a stack _Update_.
1. Once the update is successful, the new admin can log in, set roles, and
nominate other admins as needed.

## General stack update failure steps

On rare occasions, Quilt stack deployment updates might fail. This can happen
for several reasons. To expedite resolution of stack deployment issues, it's
helpful to have the following data and output from the following [AWS
CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) commands when contacting
<support@quiltdata.io>.

1. Quilt stack outputs:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    STACK_NAME="YOUR_QUILT_STACK"
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME" \
        --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
    ```

1. Initiate drift detection:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME"
    ```

1. _After drift detection is complete_:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME"
    ```

1. Quilt stack events:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    aws cloudformation describe-stack-events \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME"
    ```

## Collect logs to diagnose

To expedite the resolution of any errors encountered while using
Quilt, please capture the following logs and share them with
Quilt support:

### Browser Network and Console

1. Go to the affected page in your Quilt Catalog.
1. Open the browser Developer tools:
    - Google Chrome: Press **F12**, **Ctrl+Shift+I** or from the
    Chrome menu select **More tools > Developer tools**.
1. Select the **Network** tab.
    1. Ensure the session is recorded:
        - Google Chrome: Check the red button in the upper left corner is set to
          **Record**.
    1. Ensure **Preserve Log** is enabled.
    1. Perform the action that triggers the error (e.g. clicking the `Download
       package` button).
    1. Export the logs as HAR format.
        - Google Chrome: **Ctrl + Click** anywhere on the grid of
        network requests and select **Save all as HAR with content**.
    1. Save the HAR-formatted file to your localhost.

        ![Save browser Network error logs as HAR
        content](imgs/troubleshooting-logs-browser.png)
1. Select the **Console** tab.
    1. Perform the action that triggers the error (e.g. clicking the `Download
       package` button).
    1. Export the logs.
        - Google Chrome: **Ctrl + Click** anywhere on the grid of
        network requests and select **Save as...**.
    1. Save the log file to your localhost.

### Elastic Container Service (ECS)

1. Find the name of your Quilt stack:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    aws cloudformation list-stacks
    ```

1. Capture Quilt log events for the last 30 minutes as follows:
    <!--pytest.mark.skip-->
    ```sh
    STACK_NAME="YOUR_QUILT_STACK"
    aws logs filter-log-events \
        --log-group-name "$STACK_NAME" \
        --start-time "$(( ($(date +%s) - 1800) * 1000 ))" \
        --end-time "$(( $(date +%s) * 1000 ))" > log-quilt-ecs-events.json
    ```

### IAM permissions

Determine which principal you're using as follows:
<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### S3 objects

Inspect problematic objects with the following commands:
<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```sh
BUCKET="YOUR_BUCKET"
PREFIX="YOUR_PREFIX"
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket "$BUCKET" --prefix "$PREFIX"
aws s3api get-object-tagging --bucket "$BUCKET" --key "$PREFIX"
```

### Specific logical resources

Sometimes you may wish to find an ID or other information from a logical
resource in a Quilt stack. The following example is for security groups. Modify
the commands as needed for other resource types.

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```sh
STACK_NAME="YOUR_QUILT_STACK"
RESOURCE_ID="YOUR_LOGICAL_ID"
SG_ID=$(
  aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
    --stack-name "$STACK_NAME" \
    --logical-resource-id "$RESOURCE_ID" \
    --query 'StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId' \
    --output text
)
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids "${SG_ID}"
```

### Event source mapping

The event source mapping is a Lambda resource that reads from SQS.
<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```sh
STACK_NAME="YOUR_QUILT_STACK"
aws lambda get-event-source-mapping --uuid \
    $(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME" \
        --logical-resource-id LambdaFunctionEventSourceMapping \
        --query StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId --output text)
```

### Remediation

If for some reason the event source mapping is disabled, it can be enabled as
follows.
<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```sh
STACK_NAME="YOUR_QUILT_STACK"
aws lambda update-event-source-mapping --uuid \
    $(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
        --stack-name "$STACK_NAME" \
        --logical-resource-id LambdaFunctionEventSourceMapping \
        --query StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId \
        --output text) \
    --enabled
```
