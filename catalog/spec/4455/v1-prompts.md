## Reformat

- Rename this spec to `00`.
- Create a standalone checklist file prefixed with `0n-` for each phase.
- Update the process so that, for each phase, the corresponding checklist spec is copied into the PR for explicit check-off.
- Would this approach work?
- Ensure PRs chain linearly

## Phase 1

- Execute
- Add notes about any prompting issues
