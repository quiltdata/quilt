# `styled-components`

`styled-components` allow you to write actual CSS code in your JavaScript to style your components,
removing the mapping between components and styles.

See the
[official documentation](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
for more information!

## Usage

This creates two react components, `<Title>` and `<Wrapper>`:

```JSX
import React from 'react';

import styled from 'styled-components';

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;
```

*(The CSS rules are automatically vendor prefixed, so you don't have to think about it!)*

You render them like so:

```JSX
// Use them like any other React component â€“ except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
```
