            Your company rapidly accumulates data from instruments, CROs, scientists, and
            computational pipelines. But simply storing data adds cost without benefit.
            Data without context (labels, documentation, links, and charts) quickly
            becomes meaningless. Decision quality suffers, experiments are needlessly
            repeated, and teams waste months doing "data archaeology" to reconstruct past
            results.
