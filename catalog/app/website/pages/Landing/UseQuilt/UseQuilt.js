            Quilt runs in a virtual private cloud in your AWS account. Your data reside in
            secure services that are only accessible to individuals whom you designate.

            Quilt runs as a CloudFormation stack that orchestrates services in your AWS
            account. (Services like AWS S3, Fargate, ElasticSearch, Lambda, Athena, and
            CloudTrail.) These services form the Quilt backend that powers the Quilt web
            catalog and <code>quilt3</code> Python client. Every file in Quilt is a
            versioned S3 object secured by IAM.
