# Data Set Information
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 

This is an exceedingly simple domain. 

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,'Iris-setosa' where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,'Iris-setosa' where the errors are in the second and third features.

### all the way down to some of the smallest
#### sizes like this is h4
##### i don't know why anyone would use h5
