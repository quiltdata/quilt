# Manage data like code
It's easy to install code dependencies with projects like pip and npm. But what about data dependencies? That's where `quilt` comes in.
Install, compile, and version data with Quilt.
* **Install** and import data with simple one-liners: `from quilt.data.bob import sales`
* **Compile** files into memory-mapped binary data frames that load [5X to 20X faster than files](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/pandas-and-apache-arrow/)
* **Version** your data. Hash, tag, and version quilt data packages.

## Quilt is a data package manager
A data package is a namespace of binary data frames. You can use data packages from the community, publish packages for others to use, or keep packages private to you.

`quilt` is the command-line client that builds, retrieves, and stores
packages. `quilt` works in conjunction with a server-side registry,
not covered in this document. `quilt` currently pushes to and pulls from
the registry at [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com/package/examples/wine).


# Known Issues
-  `quilt/test/build.yml` relies on pickle and is therefore not compatible between Python 2 and Python 3.
- Anaconda with python 2.7 has an old version of `setuptools`. Strangely, `pip install --upgrade setuptools` run three times, yes three times, will ultimately succeed.


# Quick Start
1. Open Terminal
1. `$ pip install quilt`
1. `$ quilt install examples/wine` (install a sample package)
1. `$ python` (fire up python)
1. You've got data frames
```python
from quilt.data.examples import wine
wine.quality.red # this is a pandas.DataFrame
```

# Tutorial

## Install `quilt`
- `pip install git+https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt.git` (more up-to-date than `pip install quilt`)

## Install a package
Let's install the public package [examples/wine](https://quiltdata.com/package/examples/wine)
- `quilt install examples/wine`

Now let's fire up Python and import the package.
```
$ python
>>> from quilt.data.examples import wine
```
The import syntax is `from quilt.data.USER import PACKAGE`.

Let's see what's in the `wine` package:
```python
>>> wine
<class 'quilt.data.DataNode'>
File: /Users/kmoore/toa/github/quilt2/quilt_packages/examples/wine.json
Path: /
README/
quality/
>>> wine.quality
<class 'quilt.data.DataNode'>
File: /Users/kmoore/toa/github/quilt2/quilt_packages/examples/wine.json
Path: /quality/
red/
white/
>>> type(wine.quality.red)
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
>>> wine.quality.red

## Create your first package
The simplest way to create a data package is from a set of input files. Quilt's `build` command can take a source file directory as a parameter and automatically build a package based on its contents.
```
quilt build USER/PACKAGE -d PATH_TO_INPUT_FILES
```
That will create a data package USER/PACKAGE on your local machine. You can inspect the contents using:
```
quilt inspect USER/PACKAGE
```

You can now use your package locally:
```python
from quilt.data.USER import PACKAGE
```
Data packages deserialize 5x to 20x faster than text files.

## Customize package contents by editing build.yml 
Running `quilt build USER/PACKAGE -d PATH` as described above generates a data package and a file, `build.yml` that specifies the contents of the package.

Your file should look something like this:
```yaml
---
tables:
  one: [csv, src/bar/your.txt]
  two: [csv, another.csv]
  um:
    buckle: [xls, finance/excel_file.xls]
    my: [xlsx, numbers/excel_file.xlsx]
    shoe: [tsv, measurements.txt]
...
```
The above `build.yml` tells `quilt` how to build a package from a set of input files. By editing the automatically generated build.yml or creating a configuration file of your own, you can control the exact names of DataFrames and files in your package.

The tree structures under `tables` and `files` dictate the package tree. `foo.one` and `foo.two` will import as data frames. `foo.um` is a group containing three data frames. `foo.um.buckle` is a data frame, etc.

### DataFrames/Tables
Each leaf node in `tables` is specified by a list of the form
`[parser, file]`. You can have as many leaf nodes (data frames) and non-leaf nodes (groups) as you choose.

**Note**: `parser` and `file`'s extension may differ, and in
practice often do. For example `foo.one` uses the `csv`
parser to read from a `.txt` file that, contrary to its extension, is actually
in CSV format. The separation of `parser` and `file` allows you to change
parsers without changing file names.

### Supported parsers
- `xls` or `xlsx` for Excel
- `csv` for comma-separated values
- `tsv` for tab-separated values
- `ssv` for semicolon-separated values

`quilt` can be extended to support more parsers. See `TARGET` in `quilt/data/tools/constants.py`.

### Raw files
Packages can include data and other contents that are not representable as DataFrames. The `files` tree in build.yml maps names to raw input files. Those files will be included in the data package unmodified.

Files can be accessed by using the normal Python `open` method.
```python
from quilt.data.USER import PACKAGE
with open(PACKAGE.a_file, 'r') as localfile:
  print(localfile.read())
```

### Build the package using the build file
- `quilt build USER/PACKAGE build.yml`

`build` parses the source files referenced in the `tables` tree of `build.yml`, transforms them with specified parser into data frames, then serializes the data frames to memory-mapped binary formats. At present quilt packages are pandas data frames stored in HDF5. In the future we will support R, Spark, and
binary formats like Parquet.


### Push the package
So far your package lives on your local machine. Now you can
push it to a secure registry in the cloud.

1. `quilt login`. Sign in or create an account, then paste your confirmation code into
`quilt`.

1. `quilt push YOU/YOUR_PACKAGE` adds your package to the registry. By default all
packages are private to the owner (you).

**Note**: all packages are private by default, visible only to the owner. 

### Manage access
- `quilt access add YOU/YOUR_PACKAGE FRIEND`. Now user `FRIEND` can
`quilt install YOU/YOUR_PACKAGE`. In the near future
the quilt registry at [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com) will offer
a graphical user interface for easy access control.

If you wish to make a package public:
```
quilt access add YOU/YOUR_PACKAGE public
```

If you change your mind:
```
quilt access remove YOU/YOUR_PACKAGE public
```

### Version and track your packages
Once you've pushed a package to the registry, you can list its versions and tags.

#### Tags
```
quilt tag list USER/PACKAGE
```
`latest: 7f6ca2546aba49be878c7f407bb49ef9388c51be716360685bce2d2cdae4fcd1`

The tag `latest` is automatically added to the most recently pushed instance of a data package. To add a new tag, copy the package hash for the package instance you want to tag and run:
```
quilt tag add USER/PACKAGE NEW_TAG PKG_HASH
```
#### Versions
```
quilt tag list USER/PACKAGE
```
`latest: 7f6ca2546aba49be878c7f407bb49ef9388c51be716360685bce2d2cdae4fcd1`  
`newtag: 7f6ca2546aba49be878c7f407bb49ef9388c51be716360685bce2d2cdae4fcd1`

To create a new version, copy the package hash for the package instance you want to tag and run:
```
quilt version add USER/PACKAGE VERSION PKG_HASH
quilt version list USER/PACKAGE
```
`0.0.1: 7f6ca2546aba49be878c7f407bb49ef9388c51be716360685bce2d2cdae4fcd1`
