# Quilt is a package manager for data

With Quilt you can build, push, and install data packages.
To get started, visit [docs.quiltdata.com](https://docs.quiltdata.com) for installation, getting started, tutorials, and more.

# Components

Quilt consists of two components:

1. A [server-side data registry](registry)
    - Controls permissions
    - Stores pacakge fragments in blob storage
    - Stores package meta-data
    - De-duplicates repeated data fragments
    
2. A [client-side data compiler](compiler)
    - Serializes tabular data to Apache Parquet
    - `build`s packages locally
    - `push`es packages to the registry
    - `pull`s packages from the registry

# Usage

Here's a basic flow for uploading and downloading data to Quilt.
