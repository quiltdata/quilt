# Quilt is a data registry
Quilt provides versioned, reusable building blocks for analysis in the form of _data packages_. A data package may contain data of any type or size. In spirit, Quilt does for data what package managers and Docker registries do for code: provide a centralized, collaborative store of record.

## Benefits

* **Reproducibility** - Imagine source code without versions. Ouch. Why live with un-versioned data? Versioned data makes analysis reproducible by creating unambiguous references to potentially complex data dependencies.
* **Collaboration and transparency** - Data likes to be shared. Quilt offers a centralized data warehouse for finding and sharing data.
* **Auditing** - the registry tracks all reads and writes so that admins know when data are accessed or changed
* **Less data prep** - the registry abstracts away network, storage, and file format so that users can focus on what they wish to do with the data.
* **Deduplication** - Data fragments are hashed with `SHA256`. Duplicate data fragments are written to disk once globally per user. As a result, large, repeated data fragments consume less disk and network bandwidth.
* **Faster analysis** - Serialized data loads 5 to 20 times faster than files. Moreover, specialized storage formats like Apache Parquet minimize I/O bottlenecks so that tools like Presto DB and Hive run faster.

## Commands

Here are the basic Quilt commands:

## Service
Quilt is offered as a managed service at [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com).

## Architecture
Quilt consists of three source-level components:

1. A [data catalog](catalog)
    - Displays package meta-data in HTML
    - Implemented with JavaScript with redux, sagas
    
2. A [data registry](registry)
    - Controls permissions
    - Stores pacakge fragments in blob storage
    - Stores package meta-data
    - De-duplicates repeated data fragments
    - Implemented in Python with Flask and PostgreSQL
    
3. A [data compiler](compiler)
    - Serializes tabular data to Apache Parquet
    - Transforms and parses files
    - `build`s packages locally
    - `push`es packages to the registry
    - `pull`s packages from the registry
    - Implemented in Python with pandas and PyArrow
