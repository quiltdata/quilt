# Manage data like code

Quilt provides versioned, reusable building blocks for analysis in the form
of _data packages_. A data package may contain data of any type or any size.

Quilt does for data what package managers do for code:
provide a centralized store of record.

## Benefits

* **Reproducibility** - Imagine source code without versions. Ouch.
Why live with un-versioned data?
Versioned data makes analysis reproducible by creating unambiguous
references to potentially complex data dependencies.

* **Collaboration and transparency** - Data likes to be shared. Quilt offers
a unified catalog for finding and sharing data.

* **Auditing** - the registry tracks all reads and writes so that admins
know when data are accessed or changed.

* **Less data prep** - the registry abstracts away network, storage,
and file format so that users can focus on what they wish to do with the
data.

* **De-duplication** - Data are identified by their SHA-256 hash.
Duplicate data are written to disk _once_, for each user.
As a result, large, repeated data fragments consume less disk and
network bandwidth.

* **Faster analysis** - Serialized data loads 5 to 20 times faster than files.
Moreover, specialized storage formats like Apache Parquet minimize I/O
bottlenecks so that tools like Presto DB and Hive run faster.

## Key concepts

### Data package
A Quilt data package is a tree of data wrapped in a Python module.
You can think of a package as a miniature, virtualized filesystem accessible
to a variety of languages and platforms.

Each Quilt package has a unique _handle_ of the form `USER_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME`.

Packages are stored in a server-side _registry_.
The registry controls permissions and stores package meta-data, such as the
revision history. Each package has a web landing page for documentation,
[like this one](https://quiltdata.com/package/uciml/iris) for `uciml/iris`.

The data in a package are tracked in a hash tree. The _tophash_ for the tree
is the hash of all hashes of all data in the package. The combination of a
package handle and tophash form a package _instance_. Package instances are
immutable.

Leaf nodes in the package tree are called _fragments_ or _objects_. Installed
fragments are de-duplicated and kept in a local [object store](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/blob/master/docs/repo-format.md).

### Package lifecycle

### Core commands

### `build` creates a package

`build` hashes and serializes data. All data and metadata are tracked in a
hash-tree that specifies the structure of the package.

By default:
* Unstrcutured and semi-structured data are copied "as is" (e.g. JSON, TXT)
* Tabular file formats (like CSV, TSV, XLS, etc.) are parsed with
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and serialized to Parquet with
[pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/).

You may override the above defaults, for example if you wish data to remain in
its original format, with the `transform: id` setting in
[`build.yml`](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/blob/master/docs/buildyml.md).

### `push` stores a package in a server-side registry

Packages are registered against a Flask/MySQL endpoint that controls permissions
and keeps track of where data lives in blob storage (S3 for the Free tier).

### `install` downloads a package

After a permissions check the client receives a signed URL to download the
package from blob storage.

Installed packages are stored in a local `quilt_modules` folder.
Type `$ quilt ls` to see where `quilt_modules` is located.

### `import` exposes your package to code
Quilt data packages are wrapped in a Python module so that users can import
data like code: `from quilt.data.USER_NAME import PACKAGE_NAME`.

Data `import` is lazy to minimize I/O. Data are only loaded from disk
if and when the user references the data (usually by adding parenthesis to
a package path, `pkg.foo.bar()`).

## Service
Quilt is offered as a managed service at [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com).
Alternatively, users can run their own registries (refer to the
[registry documentation](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/blob/master/registry/README.md)).

## Architecture
Quilt consists of three components. See the
[contributing docs](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for further details.
