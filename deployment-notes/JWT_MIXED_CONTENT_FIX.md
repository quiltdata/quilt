# JWT Mixed Content Error - CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

## üö® Problem Identified

Your diagnostic output shows the **real issue**:

```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://demo.quiltdata.com/' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://demo.quiltdata.com/mcp/?t=1759404707288'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

### What This Means:
- ‚ùå Your MCP endpoint is configured as **HTTP** (not HTTPS)
- ‚ùå The browser **blocks all HTTP requests** from HTTPS pages (security policy)
- ‚ùå The JWT **never reaches the server** - requests are blocked before sending
- ‚ùå This is why "JWT is not being accepted" - it never gets there!

## ‚úÖ Good News From Diagnostic

The diagnostic showed:
1. ‚úÖ **Token exists** - MCP Client has valid 225-char JWT
2. ‚úÖ **Token is properly formatted** - Valid JWT structure
3. ‚úÖ **Headers are correct** - Authorization header present
4. ‚úÖ **Redux callback works** - Token retrieval successful

**So the JWT handling is actually working fine!** The problem is the HTTP/HTTPS mismatch.

## üîç Verify the Issue

Run this in browser console to confirm:

```javascript
// Check current MCP endpoint config
const config = window.QUILT_CATALOG_CONFIG
console.log('MCP Endpoint:', config?.mcpEndpoint)
console.log('Is HTTP?', config?.mcpEndpoint?.startsWith('http://'))
console.log('Should be HTTPS?', true)
```

Expected output if issue exists:
```
MCP Endpoint: http://demo.quiltdata.com/mcp
Is HTTP? true
Should be HTTPS? true
```

## üîß Fix Steps

### Step 1: Verify Task Definition

The task definition looks correct:

```json
{
  "name": "MCP_ENDPOINT",
  "value": "https://demo.quiltdata.com/mcp"  // ‚úÖ Has HTTPS
}
```

### Step 2: Check If Latest Task Is Deployed

<function_calls>
<invoke name="run_terminal_cmd">
<parameter name="command">aws ecs describe-services --cluster sales-prod --services sales-prod-nginx_catalog --query 'services[0].{runningTaskDefinition:taskDefinition,deployments:deployments[0].{status:status,taskDef:taskDefinition}}'
