# Qurator Authentication Refactor - Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Critical Issue:** Conflicting authentication approaches detected

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Architecture Conflict Detected

### The Problem

You have **TWO INCOMPATIBLE** authentication implementations:

#### ‚ùå Old Approach (COMPLETE_MCP_AUTH_FIX_SPECIFICATION.md)
- Creates "enhanced JWTs" in the browser
- Stores JWT signing secret (`mcpEnhancedJwtSecret`) in frontend config
- Signs tokens client-side with roles, permissions, buckets
- Uses compression/decompression for JWT claims
- Complex token enhancement flow with `DynamicAuthManager`

#### ‚úÖ New Approach (Alexei's Recommendation)
- **Never** create or sign JWTs in browser
- **Never** store secrets in browser
- Reuse existing catalog auth token from local storage
- Backend is completely stateless
- Replace all Quilt3 calls with GraphQL/REST API

### Alexei's Direct Quote from Transcript

> **"Basically, I think for this case, you should just reuse the token. Catalog has a single token, authentication token, which is stored in local storage and is available in different places throughout the application code. And you should just send this token to the server, and then server can use this token to make requests to the backend, to all the endpoints in the registry."**

> **"Well, I realize that it's a demo, but it's like fundamentally wrong because you are keeping the secret in the browser and you are signing the token in the browser, that's, like, you can do this, really."** (when asked about security vs practicality: **"The secret is kept in the backend."**)

## Decision Required

Before proceeding, you must decide:

### Option A: Implement Alexei's Approach (Recommended)
- **Pros:**
  - Architecturally sound
  - No security issues
  - Simpler implementation
  - Recommended by lead architect
  - Will work in production long-term
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires removing existing enhanced JWT code
  - Different from what's currently implemented
  - More backend refactoring needed

- **Timeline:** ~2-3 days of refactoring

### Option B: Keep Current Enhanced JWT Approach
- **Pros:**
  - Already implemented
  - Works for demo purposes
  - Can ship quickly
  
- **Cons:**
  - **Fundamentally insecure** (secrets in browser)
  - Not production-ready
  - Will need to be rewritten later
  - May not pass security review
  - Alexei won't support long-term

- **Timeline:** Deploy now, rewrite later

---

## Recommended Path: Hybrid Approach for Summit Demo

Given the tight timeline (Summit on Oct 15), here's a pragmatic approach:

### Phase 1: Minimal Secure Demo (For Summit - Oct 15)

#### Frontend Changes (Quick)
1. **Remove JWT creation from browser**
   - Delete `EnhancedTokenGenerator.js` logic that signs tokens
   - Remove `mcpEnhancedJwtSecret` from frontend config
   - Simplify `DynamicAuthManager` to just get token from Redux state

2. **Use existing catalog token**
   - Get token from local storage via Redux
   - Pass token directly to MCP server
   - No enhancement, no signing

3. **Files to modify:**
   ```
   catalog/app/components/Assistant/MCP/Client.ts
   catalog/app/components/Assistant/MCP/MCPContextProvider.tsx
   catalog/app/services/DynamicAuthManager.js (simplify drastically)
   ```

#### Backend Changes (Quick)
1. **Accept standard catalog auth token**
   - Validate using registry's validation endpoint
   - Don't expect enhanced claims
   - Extract permissions from registry API

2. **Use auth token for all API calls**
   - Pass token in headers to GraphQL/REST
   - Let registry handle authorization
   - Don't cache any auth state

### Phase 2: Full Production Implementation (Post-Summit)

Follow the complete specifications:
- `QURATOR_FRONTEND_AUTH_SPEC.md`
- `QURATOR_BACKEND_MCP_AUTH_SPEC.md`

## Files That Need Immediate Attention

### ‚ùå DELETE or DEPRECATE

```
catalog/app/services/EnhancedTokenGenerator.js
catalog/app/services/jwt-decompression-utils.js
catalog/app/services/MCP_Server_JWT_Decompression_Guide.md
catalog/app/services/JWTCompressionFormat.md
catalog/app/services/test-jwt-decompression.js
COMPLETE_MCP_AUTH_FIX_SPECIFICATION.md (old approach)
CROSS_VERIFICATION_TEST.js (tests wrong approach)
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è SIMPLIFY Drastically

```
catalog/app/services/DynamicAuthManager.js
  ‚Üí Should be ~50 lines, not 500+
  ‚Üí Just get token from Redux, that's it

catalog/app/components/Assistant/MCP/Client.ts
  ‚Üí Remove enhanced token validation
  ‚Üí Just get token and add to header

catalog/app/components/Assistant/MCP/MCPContextProvider.tsx
  ‚Üí Remove token enhancement flow
  ‚Üí Just pass Redux token to client
```

### ‚úÖ KEEP and REFACTOR

```
catalog/app/services/mcpAuthorization.js
  ‚Üí Still useful for role mapping
  ‚Üí May need to work differently

catalog/app/services/BucketDiscoveryService.js
  ‚Üí Still useful for finding buckets
  ‚Üí May move to backend
```

## Known Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Token Not Available
**Risk:** Redux token getter returns null  
**Mitigation:** Add fallback error handling, show user error message  
**Test:** Try MCP request before login

### Risk 2: Token Expired
**Risk:** Catalog token expires mid-session  
**Mitigation:** Listen for token refresh events in Redux  
**Test:** Force token expiration

### Risk 3: Backend Can't Validate Token
**Risk:** Backend can't reach registry to validate  
**Mitigation:** Proper error handling, retry logic  
**Test:** Simulate registry downtime

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation
**Risk:** Every request needs token from Redux  
**Mitigation:** Redux selectors are fast, minimal overhead  
**Test:** Load test with many concurrent requests

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Metrics to Watch

#### Frontend
- Token retrieval success rate
- Authorization header attachment rate
- MCP request success rate
- Error rate by error type

#### Backend
- Token validation success rate
- API call success rate to registry
- Response time percentiles
- Error rate by endpoint

### Alerts to Configure

- Auth token retrieval failures > 5%
- MCP request failures > 10%
- Backend auth errors > 5%
- Response time > 5 seconds
