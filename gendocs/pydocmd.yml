# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.
generate:
- api.md:
  # By referencing this directly, we include its docstring.
  - quilt3:
    # If we end up wanting to include Bucket and Package inline in api.md, we
    # might just want to specify "__all__" in quilt3.__init__ and use 'quilt3+' on the
    # line above this comment.  Specified explicitly for this example.
    - quilt3.config
    - quilt3.delete_package
    - quilt3.list_packages
# Uncomment the following two lines in include these classes directly in api.md
#    - Bucket+
#    - Package+

- Bucket.md:
  - quilt3.Bucket+    # All *documented* members, except _private_members.

- Package.md:
  - quilt3.Package+   # All *documented* members, except _private_members.


# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd

# in the documentation. The path must be relative to current working directory.
# This configuration is not mandatory if you have your own mkdocs.yml config file.

# Whether to output headings as markdown or HTML.  Used to workaround
# https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown/issues/11.  The default is
# to generate HTML with unique and meaningful id tags, which can't be done with
# markdown.
#
# Note: if using the simple generator mode, this will default to 'markdown'
# instead of 'html'.
#
# badly-named as 'headers' instead of 'headings'.
